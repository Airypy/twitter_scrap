To get started, you’ll need to do the following things:

-Set up a Twitter account if you don’t have one already.
-Using your Twitter account, you will need to apply for Developer Access and then create an application that will generate the API credentials that you will use to access Twitter from Python.
-Import the tweepy package.

Once you’ve done these things, you are ready to begin querying Twitter’s API to see what you can learn about tweets!

Set up Twitter App:-

After you have applied for Developer Access, you can create an application in Twitter that you can use to access tweets. Make sure you already have a Twitter account.

To create your application, you can follow a useful tutorial from rtweet, which includes a section on Create an application that is not specific to R:
